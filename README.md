Project Details: Pharmacy Management System 
Application to help pharmacist to mange pharmacy in the 
systematic ways. This system can make the work easier 
by giving the details of medicine when its name is entered.
A computer gives the details of the medicine like rate of 
medicine and expiry date of medicine. It becomes very 
difficult in big medical stores to handle the details of all 
medicine manually , so by using this pharmacy 
management system we can maintain the record of all the 
medicine. 
In this system there will be an Admin who can control like 
can add user, edit user, update and delete user. To 
access this admin panel one first to need to login by using 
username and password.

medicine, delete medicine. This one also need to access 
by using user name and password.
This system will do some activities like store medicine 
data, search medicine data efficiency, update ,delete, edit 
medicine information and prepare bill for medicine.
